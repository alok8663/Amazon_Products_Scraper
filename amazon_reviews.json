These educational wooden toy blocks add up to wholesome fun for everyone. Add more sets for more complexity and older children. Reduces screen time, stimulates active engagement & curiosity in children. Did you know? Children learn how to create different structures using building blocks, and this stimulates their creative mind. Building blocks are a great way to encourage a child’s creative abilities and not just the logical.\nEngaging curious minds: How does it work? Figuring things out is one of the best parts of play—from simple challenges to more complex ones.\nFrom grasping a toy to holding a pencil, developing fine motor skills helps lead to success in school and beyond.\nEncouraging that natural sense of wonder and amazement will help your child want to learn more—every day!\n100% good for your child\nToys have been found to have toxic materials, sharp edges that hurt and at times even break or tear and are unsafe for children. Our environmentally conscious toys are made from natural organic materials, wood and non toxic colours. We keep child safety in mind at all times, so even you as a parent can be as carefree as a child during playtime!\nA way to natural development for the child\nWe follow the 90% child, 10% toy philosophy that allows every child to blossom in their own space. With our environmentally conscious, wooden toys children can explore the world around and develop at their own pace. No screens and no batteries and no toxic stuff. Just pure natural organic fun!\nMeeta Sharma Gupta, Founder\nDescribe your products in three words.\nExplore , Create, Discover\nHow did you come up with the idea for this product?\nWhen in the US, I loved how my little boys played with open ended, yet simple toys – toys that allowed them to explore & discover rather than direct what they did. For instance, they played for hours together with building blocks creating imaginary castles, tallest towers and shapes that only they imagined! On moving back to India I searched for similar ‘open & explorative’, natural, safe & high quality toys. I found very little & what I found was very expensive. I knew that exploration & discovery based play was key in a child’s development – most of which happened in their initial years. That’s when I decided to create such unique toys myself!\nWhat makes your product special?\nAt Shumee we make it a simple art of buying a toy simple. We keep children in mind all through the design, development, make and quality control of our products. Our design philosophy is rooted in bringing back the joy of playing and empowering the child to explore, discover and develop at their own pace, in the most natural manner. The Made-in-India Shumee toys adhere to the highest international natural material, quality and safety standards.\nWhat has been the best part of your experience?\nThe best part of the journey with Shumee has been to see little ones play excitedly with their shumee toy, the feeling of bringing a concept to an actual product and the priceless smiles on little ones has been quite rewarding. We want to grow this feeling with each and every toy that comes from Shumee, we want to do our little bit in giving the children a tacitle play experience, an experience that is rooted in basics and at the same time be consciousous of our choices with respect to the environment too.",
